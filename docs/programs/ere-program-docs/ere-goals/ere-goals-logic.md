### 2025

- **2025-10-04**: Adds collapsible `<details markdown="1"></details>` section to the changelog. Adds year subsection to better organize long changelog lists.
- **2025-09-21**: Removes `lifecycle:` and `change-control:` fields from frontmatter as they are more appropriate for assets outside of the context of the wiki and since they overlap with tags such as `archived`, `needs-review`, `production-ready`, `change-management`, `implementation-planning`, and `stakeholder-approval`. Adds `nav_order:` and `parent:` fields to frontmatter.
- **2025-09-19**: Renames file to `ere-goals-logic.md` so that it can nest under the folder `ere-goals` without conflicting permalinks. Adds `permalink:` and `layout:` fields to frontmatter.
- **2025-07-24**: Adds Markdown file named `ere-goals.md` to document ERE program goals. Adds FY26 goals.
