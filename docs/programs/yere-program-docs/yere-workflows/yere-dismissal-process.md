# YERE Enrollment Dismissal Process

## Description

Documents the process for dismissing ERE program enrollments.

## Outreach Process Pre-Dismissal

- From the point of last contact, 2-3 weeks of intensive phone outreach (calling 1-2 times per week, trying various numbers).  
- At 2-3 weeks since last contact, send a final contact letter with a 2 week timeline for the family to reach out (see examples attached).  
- During those last two weeks, continue intensive phone outreach (1-2 calls per week).  
- If no response by the end of these 5 weeks, you may choose to complete dismissal touchpoint and email Theresa to dismiss.  
- Overall, the youth should get a minimum of 4-5 weeks of intensive phone outreach and a letter sent to the address we have on file before dismissing.

## Dismissal Form and Email

When you are ready to dismiss a client:

- If relevant, update the youth’s last-completed pathway form needs section to reflect any resources you connected them with since the last form was completed.  
- Thoroughly document engagement efforts or dismissal conversation with caregiver in FAMCare Case Notes.  
- Send a dismissal request via email to the Assistant Coordinator (cc Coordinator) with youth's name, date of dismissal, and reason for dismissal. See below dismissal reason "dictionary."

| Dismissal   Reason                                   | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unable to locate/make contact post-referral          | Dismissal reason used only in the case of a youth who we get a referral for and are never able to connect with caregiver or youth in the community post-discharge. We may or may not have met with the youth in the hospital, but the determining factor is whether   we were ever able to contact/schedule an initial contact meeting with the family. We usually dismiss at 4-6 weeks post-discharge if unable to locate after 30 days of intensive outreach and an attempt-to-contact letter is sent.                                                                               |
| Caregiver declined services                          | Dismissal reason used when the caregiver declines working with YERE to get connected to agency services or find other supportive services in the community. This reason should be selected when   caregiver declines early-on in the engagement process, generally at the point where they understand the services YERE provides and decide it’s not a good fit for them or is unnecessary. This reason can also be selected when some engagement with family has been established, some referrals have been provided, and caregiver simply feels YERE support is no longer necessary. |
| Youth declined services                              | Dismissal reason used when youth is independent/able to make their own decisions about engaging in services OR they decline to engage and the caregiver supports this decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Disengaged from services/lost contact after engaging | This is the broadest dismissal reason. This dismissal reason is used in the case of youth who have an initial contact or who we have had some contact with post-discharge, but who eventually disengage, stop answering calls, or become unavailable to contact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Program completion                                   | Dismissal reason used when 6 months has elapsed, all forms are completed. Check for IC, 30 day, 3 month, 6 month, BHS, and dismissal touchpoint completion before emailing to dismiss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Reconnect                                            | Dismissal reason used when the youth has an existing team at a CMHC/are already consistently receiving services. We reconnect them with that team (reach out to the team, let them know that the youth was hospitalized, encourage they reach out within the next week) and discharge. Before dismissing, ensure that the care team reconnected with the youth, and complete a BHS with “Reconnection Path” selected.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Reconnect with intensive support                     | Dismissal reason when the youth has an existing team at a CMHC/are already receiving services. We reconnect them with that team but there seem to be other barriers to this connection being successful. We will keep their case open for a while until the reconnection is successful, then dismiss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| CMHC determined ineligible                           | Dismissal reason for when a youth’s status changes such that they cease to meet program eligibility criteria. This usually happens when a youth moves out of our program catchment area, ages out and is more appropriate for adult services, or goes to residential or detention indefinitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Administrative                                       | Dismissal reason utilized primarily for closing out program enrollment on a new referral within the 6 month program enrollment for an already-active youth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Youth entered residential facility                   | We use this dismissal touchpoint when a youth is not able to engage in YERE services to get connected to care in the community because they have entered residential services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
