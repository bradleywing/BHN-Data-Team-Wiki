# YERE Goals

## FY26

- 80% of all referred clients complete an Initial Assessment
- Among those who complete an Initial Assessment, 60% complete admission to a behavioral health service
- 50% of enrolled clients will have at least one identified need addressed/met.
- Currently unspecified Family Support Provider goal to be added.

## Changelog

- **2025-09-21**: Removes `lifecycle:` and `change-control:` fields from frontmatter as they are more appropriate for assets outside of the context of the wiki and since they overlap with tags such as `archived`, `needs-review`, `production-ready`, `change-management`, `implementation-planning`, and `stakeholder-approval`. Adds `nav_order:` and `parent:` fields to frontmatter.
- **2025-09-19**: Renames file name to `yere-goals-logic.md` to avoid conflict with the permalink between the `yere-goals` folder and the file. Adds `permalink:` and `layout:` fields to frontmatter.
- **2025-07-24**: Adds Markdown file named `yere-goals.md` for documenting YERE program goals. Adds FY26 goals.
