# Change Control Process

To ensure consistency, data integrity, and effective collaboration, a formal change control process must be followed for all modifications to the database, forms, and reports. This process provides a structured approach for managing and implementing change requests.

## Best Practices for Change Control

- Group non-urgent changes to be addressed during scheduled maintenance windows.
- Prioritize changes based on their potential impact and urgency.
- Maintain a central repository for tracking all change requests and their statuses.

## Steps in the Change Control Process

1. **Request Submission:**

    - All change requests must be submitted using the standardized [`Change Request Form`]({{site.baseurl}}/change-request-form/).
    - The form should include:
        - Requester details (name, program, and role).
        - Description of the requested change.
        - Justification and expected outcomes.
        - Deadline (if applicable) and priority level.

2. **Approval Workflow:**

    - **Initial Review:** The Data Team reviews the technical feasibility and potential impacts of the request by completing the [`Change Scope Form`]({{site.baseurl}}/change-scope-form/).

    - **Stakeholder Feedback:** The proposed change is shared with relevant program staff and leadership for input and prioritization.
    - **Final Approval:** Changes are approved based on feedback, feasibility, and alignment with organizational goals.

3. **Implementation and Testing:**

    - Changes must first be implemented and tested in the development environment.
    - A rollback plan must be defined before promoting changes to production.
    - Testing should include edge cases and potential impacts on related systems.

4. **Documentation:**

    - Update the `Change Log` to include:
        - Date of change.
        - Version number.
        - Author of the change.
        - Summary of the update.
    - Modify relevant documentation, such as any relevant [Data Dictionaries]({{site.baseurl}}/data-dictionaries/), form instructions, or technical manuals, to reflect the changes.

5. **Communication:**

    - Notify program staff of approved changes through email, meetings, or training sessions.
    - Provide clear instructions on how the changes affect workflows or reporting processes.

6. **Post-Implementation Review:**

    - After deployment, review the change's impact to ensure it achieves the intended goals.
    - Address any issues or feedback from users promptly.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Data Team:** Responsible for technical implementation, testing, and documentation.
- **Program Leadership:** Provides feedback and ensures changes align with program goals.
- **Requesters:** Submit detailed change requests and assist in validating updates.
