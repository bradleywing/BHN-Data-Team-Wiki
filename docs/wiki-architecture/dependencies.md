# BHN Data Team Wiki — Dependency Overview

This page documents the core dependencies, configuration logic, and architectural quirks of the BHN Data Team Wiki. It supports contributor onboarding, troubleshooting, and long-term sustainability.

---

## Core Ruby Gems

| Gem | Version | Purpose | Notes |
|-----|---------|---------|-------|
| `jekyll` | `~> 4.3.2` (resolved: `4.3.4`) | Static site generator | Must align with [GitHub Pages supported versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/) |
| `jekyll-remote-theme` | `0.4.3` | Loads theme from GitHub repo | Forked theme used: `Behavioral-Health-Network/git-wiki-theme` |
| `jekyll-feed` | `0.17.0` | Generates RSS feed | Optional plugin |
| `jekyll-seo-tag` | `2.8.0` | Adds SEO metadata | Optional plugin |
| `csv` | `3.3.5` | Enables CSV parsing | Used for future scripting |
| `logger` | `1.7.0` | Logging utility | Used for future scripting |
| `base64` | `0.3.0` | Encoding utility | Used for future scripting |

> **Tip**: All gems are declared in `Gemfile`; resolved versions are visible in `Gemfile.lock`. GitHub Pages ignores `Gemfile.lock` unless using GitHub Actions. `Gemfile.lock` is listed in the .gitignore. Refer to [Understanding Ruby Version Constraints](#understanding-ruby-version-constraints) for how `~>` works and why it matters.

---

## Understanding Ruby Version Constraints

Ruby’s `Gemfile` uses version operators to control which versions of a gem are allowed. The most common is `~>`, known as the **pessimistic version constraint**.

```ruby
gem "jekyll", "~> 4.3.2"
```

This means:

- Accept any version starting at `4.3.2`
- Allow patch-level updates like `4.3.3`, `4.3.4`, `4.3.99`
- Do not allow minor version bumps like `4.4.0` or `5.0.0`

> **Note**: Think of it as: “Stick to the `4.3.x` series, starting at `4.3.2`.” The actual version installed locally (e.g., `4.3.4`) is recorded in Gemfile.lock. This distinction helps contributors understand what’s allowed vs. what’s installed, and supports reproducible builds.

---

## Jekyll Configuration (`_config.yaml`)

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `remote_theme` | `Behavioral-Health-Network/git-wiki-theme` | Loads forked theme |
| `markdown` | `kramdown` | Markdown engine |
| `highlighter` | `rouge` | Syntax highlighting |
| `permalink` | `/:path/` | Clean URLs |
| `collections` | `docs` | Enables sidebar logic |
| `defaults` | `layout: home` | Applies custom homepage layout |

> **Note**: Layout fallback issue was resolved by forking `Drassil/git-wiki-theme` and then manually creating `home.html` in `Behavioral-Health-Netowrk/git-wiki-theme/_layouts/` because the `git-wiki-theme` lacks a default homepage layout.

---

## Theme Customizations

- Forked from [`git-wiki-theme`](https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme)
- `home.html` manually added to resolve `layout: default` failure
- `_includes/` and `_layouts/` currently empty in local repo; can be populated from fork of `git-wiki-theme`
- Sidebar navigation scaffolded via `navigation.yaml`

---

## Navigation Schema (`navigation.yaml`)

- Sidebar structure defined manually
- Supports nested sections for workflows, reports, data dictionaries, and contributor guides

---

## Local Development Setup

To support consistent builds and contributor onboarding, the following local setup is recommended:

- **Ruby Version**:  
  - This project currently uses Ruby `3.4.5` locally, as specified in `.ruby-version`
  - GitHub Pages currently builds with Ruby `3.1.2`, so contributors may need to switch Ruby versions using a version manager like `rbenv`, `rvm`, or `asdf` to ensure compatibility
  > **Tip**: If you encounter build issues or plugin mismatches, try switching to Ruby `3.1.2` to match GitHub’s environment
- **`.ruby-version`**:  
  - Located in the root directory. Helps contributors auto-switch Ruby versions when entering the repo
- **`.jekyll-metadata`**:  
  - This file is generated automatically by Jekyll during local builds to optimize incremental rendering
  - It is ignored via `.gitignore` and should not be committed.
- **Bundler**:  
  - Use `bundle install` to install dependencies defined in `Gemfile`.
  - `Gemfile.lock` is ignored unless using GitHub Actions or a custom build pipeline
- **Build Commands**:  
  - Run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to preview the site locally.
- **Optional Tools**:  
  - The `/assets/scripts/` folder is reserved for future parsers that will interact with this repo, the `FAMCare-HTML-Form-Code` repo, and the `FAMCare-SQL-Toolkit` repo
  - Gems like `csv`, `logger`, and `base64` are pre-declared in the `Gemfile` to support this work
  - Specific implementation details will be documented once scripting is active
- **Markdownlint Setup**:
  - For `Markdownlint` setup and linting rules, see [Markdownlint Configuration](#markdownlint-configuration)

---

## Dependency Updates

- Run `bundle outdated` to audit gems
- Update `Gemfile` manually and run `bundle update`
- Test locally before publishing
- Monitor [GitHub Pages dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/) for compatibility

---

## Contributor Guidance

- Dependencies are declared in `Gemfile`, not `Gemfile.lock`
- Theme quirks (e.g. missing homepage layout) are documented
- Navigation logic will be updated to match permalink structure
- Future scripting will use `csv`, `logger`, and `base64` gems

---

## Markdownlint Configuration

- **Purpose**: Enforces consistent Markdown formatting across documentation projects
- **Installation**:
  - Install the [Markdownlint extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
- **Configuration**:
  - Each repo includes a `.markdownlint.json` file at the root level
  - This file defines project-specific linting rules (e.g., allowing mixed code fence styles, permitted HTML tags)
  - Do not override these rules in your local `settings.json` unless explicitly documented
- **Usage**:
  - Linting errors will appear in the Problems pane in VS Code
  - Resolve all errors before committing documentation changes
